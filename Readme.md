This is a Python project that allows you to encode or decode a message. 
You can enter a message, and the program will either scramble 
it (encoding) or unscramble it (decoding) based on your choice.

Features:
~Encode a message: Scrambles the letters of words with more than 3 characters and adds extra characters to the beginning and end.
~Decode a message: Reverts an encoded message back to its original form.
~Reverses shorter words (with less than 3 characters).
